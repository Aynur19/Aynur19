## About me
I am 27 years old and have been programming for 10 years (including 6 years in university).

I really enjoy programming! I always try to learn something new, especially when it comes to IT-sphere. My favorite areas in the IT field:
1. Game Development: 
2. Mobile app development
3. Development on the .NET platform
4. Computer graphics
5. Neural networks and machine learning (Python, Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow)

All of the above is interesting to me, and in each of the areas I have some experience. In fact, I like that I develop in many directions, and not go deep in just one direction. And I would be happy to participate in projects with different directions from the above.


## Tech stack I have experience with:

1. .NET Development: 

`.NET Core` `C#` `C/C++` `Entity Framework Core` `ASP.NET` 

2. iOS Development: 

`Swift` `SwiftUI` `Core Data` `Combine` `KeyChain` `UIKit` `Concurrency` 

3. Neural networks and machine learning:
`Python 3` `Keras` `Pandas` `Numpy` `PyThorch` `TensorFlow` `SK-Learn` 

4. Game Development & CGI:
`Blender` `Unity` `Unreal Engine`

5. Databases and containerization:

`PostgreSQL`, `MS SQL Server`, `MongoDB`, `Docker`

6. Version control and CI/CD systems:
`Git`, `GitHub`, `GitLab`, `BitBucket`

7. Other:
`JavaScript` `Visual Studio` `VS Code` `Xcode` `Jupyter Notebook` `PyCharm` `Google Colab` `Kaggle`


## What I'm working on now

Currently, I am focused on iOS development with Swift (UIKit, SwiftUI), but I am open to learning new technologies or working with ones Iâ€™ve previously used.

Open to job offers!

Good luck to everyone!
